# Generator scripts

The prototxts can be visualized by [ethereon](http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/quickstart.html).

Every model has a bn (batch normalization) version (maybe only bn version), the paper is [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167v3)

run make_net.py to generate prototxt:
    ```
    python make_net.py
    ```
