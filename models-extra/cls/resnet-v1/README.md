### Resnet-v1

resnet_v1.py can generate resnet-v1 prototxt files with different depths.

The detail is described in the paper **Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition** (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

The original caffe models of resnet50-v1ï¼Œresnet101-v1, resnet152-v1 can be downloaded from https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks.


### Notes
There are some differences in layer naming between original resnet and this resnet prototxt, but the model structure is exactly the same.
